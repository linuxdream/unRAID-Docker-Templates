# RStudio Docker for unRAID

This RStudio docker was created by [Rocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/). I simply wrapped it into an unRAID Docker template that allows you to specify:

- Main exposed port
- Username
- Password
- Directory to store project files (basically the user's home directory)
